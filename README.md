# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Simulation
This project simulates the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using Python, the simpy library for discrete-event simulation, and matplotlib for visualization.

# Project Overview
The SDLC phases are modeled as sequential processes with specific durations:

- Requirements Gathering <br>
- Design <br>
- Development <br>
- Testing <br>
- Deployment <br>

The simulation records the start and end times of each phase and visualizes them in a Gantt chart-style plot to display the flow of the SDLC timeline.

# Features

1. Simulates each SDLC phase using SimPy with time-based delays.

2. Outputs the start and end times for all phases.
3. Generates a visual timeline of the SDLC phases using Matplotlib.
4. Modular design: each SDLC phase is implemented as a separate function.

# Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3.x
* SimPy (for simulation)
* Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```
pip install simpy matplotlib
```
