Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Simulation

This project simulates the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using Python, the SimPy library for discrete-event simulation, and Matplotlib for visualization.
Project Overview
The SDLC phases are modeled as sequential processes with specific durations:

Requirements Gathering
Design
Development
Testing
Deployment

The simulation records the start and end times of each phase and visualizes them in a Gantt chart-style plot to display the flow of the SDLC timeline.

Features
Simulates Each SDLC Phase: Utilizes SimPy with time-based delays to represent each phase.

Outputs Start and End Times: Records and displays the timing of all phases.

Visual Timeline Generation: Creates a Gantt chart using Matplotlib to visualize the SDLC phases.

Modular Design: Each SDLC phase is implemented as a separate function for clarity and maintainability.

Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
